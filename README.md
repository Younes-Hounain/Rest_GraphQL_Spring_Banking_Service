# Practical Activity #2: Micro-Service Development
## Inspired by Mr.Mohamed YOUSFI

# Objective: Creating a micro-service using Spring Boot, exposing a Restful API, and establishing a GraphQL Web Service.

  In this practical activity, the goal is to develop a micro-service using the Spring Boot framework. 
The primary objectives include the creation of a micro-service that exposes a Restful API, allowing for communication and data exchange through standard HTTP methods. 
Additionally, there is a focus on incorporating a Web Service using GraphQL, a query language for APIs that enables more efficient and powerful interactions with the micro-service.
